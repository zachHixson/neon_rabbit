# Neon Rabbit
A small cyberpunk text adventure made for one an "interactive design" course I took while in college.

Originally the project was done in an archaic format called "interactive PDF," which was absolutely horrible to work with, so instead of letting the project rot on my computer I decided to convert it to a custom JavaScript engine.

The engine itself is found in `main.js` and all of the game data is found in `RoomMap.js`
